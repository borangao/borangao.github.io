## About
Hi! Iâ€™m Boran Gao, a Ph.D candidate in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/phd-student-profiles/gao-boran.html). I have a broad interest in statistical genetics and genomics including, GWAS, heritability/genetic correlation estimation, mendelian randomization, and fine-mapping, integrating GWAS and spatial transcriptomics.

## My work and research
I work in the field of statistical genetics, mainly developing statistical tools for GWAS studies. I have experience in developing models for genetic correlation estimation, mendelian randomization and fine-mapping across ancestries. For the detailed research description and tools developed, please [visit](https://borangao.github.io/publications/).

## My background and history
I received my M.S. in Biostatistics from the [University of Michigan, School of Public Health](https://sph.umich.edu/), my MPH in Epidemiology from the [University of Michigan, School of Public Health](https://sph.umich.edu/), and my MBBS in [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/).
