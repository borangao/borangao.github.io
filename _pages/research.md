### GECKO
GECKO is a software for genetic correlation estimation. The work was published in PLOS GENETICS titled "Accurate genetic and environmental covariance estimation with composite likelihood in genome-wide association studies". GECKO can be download [here](https://github.com/borangao/GECKO) with detailed example and descriptions.
