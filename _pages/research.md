### MESuSIE
MESuSIE is a software for multi-ancestry fine-mapping. This work is in Press in Nature Genetics titled "MESuSiE enables scalable and powerful multi-ancestry
fine-mapping of causal variants in genome-wide association studies". The software can be found [here](https://github.com/borangao/meSuSie). We also provided detailed instruction and analysis example [here](https://borangao.github.io/meSuSie_Analysis/), and a web application [here](https://borangao.shinyapps.io/meSuSie/)

### GECKO
GECKO is a software for genetic correlation estimation. The work was published in PLOS GENETICS titled "Accurate genetic and environmental covariance estimation with composite likelihood in genome-wide association studies". GECKO can be download [here](https://github.com/borangao/GECKO) with detailed example and descriptions.
