The project is on going. We developed a statistical tool for multiple ancestry fine-mapping. The software can be found [here](https://github.com/borangao/meSuSie). We also provided detailed illustration example [here](https://borangao.github.io/meSuSie_Analysis/), and a web application [here](https://borangao.shinyapps.io/meSuSie/)
